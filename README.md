# 🧙‍♀️ Arcane UI Grimoire

_“A red panda’s ongoing scroll of frontend enchantments, layout mishaps, and tumbling discoveries.”_

Welcome to my personal UI dev spellbook! This is where I study, scribble, break, and rebuild my understanding of frontend magic — one div, one bug, and one brilliant "aha!" at a time.

## 🐾 What Lives in This Grimoire?

- 🧩 **HTML Hexes** – semantic spells and structural scrolls  
- 🎨 **CSS Charms** – selector incantations, layout potions, and box-shadow trickery  
- 🧠 **JS Jinxes & Justifications** – the logic side of chaos  
- 🧱 **Component Rituals** – crafting reusable, enchanted UI elements  
- 🧪 **Statecraft & Spellbinding** – managing UI state like a true sorcerer  
- ✍️ **Study Logs** – daily brain dumps, tangents, breakthroughs, and breakdowns  
- 🐉 **Blog Drafts** – stories from the UI dungeon  

## 🔮 Current Spells I'm Working On

- `🧪 Flexus Maxima`: mastering flexbox layout
- `⚖️ Semanticus`: learning what *really* makes HTML semantic
- `🕳️ Scrollaria`: exploring scroll behavior and accessibility

## 🌿 How This Works

This is a living, breathing study journal. I don’t polish everything here — I **tumble**, I **fail**, I **reflect**. And through that chaos... learning happens. 🌱
